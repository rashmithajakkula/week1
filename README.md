🌱 Carbon Emissions Prediction from Country-Specific Data

This project predicts CO₂ emissions using historical, country-level environmental and economic data. Built in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, it showcases steps from data preparation and exploratory analysis to feature selection and model building.

📌 Project Overview
This notebook is focused on:

Cleaning and preparing the dataset

Handling missing values and outliers

Normalizing and transforming variables

Encoding categorical features for ML models

It serves as the foundational data preprocessing step for the broader goal: predicting CO₂ emissions based on features like energy use, population, industry growth, etc.

🧠 Objective
To develop a machine learning-ready dataset that can accurately predict carbon emissions by country using various socio-economic indicators.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Features of the Dataset
Country name and region

Yearly emissions data

Population and GDP

Energy consumption metrics (coal, gas, oil)

Industrial and transportation statistics

🔍 Next Steps
Build regression and ensemble models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluate performance metrics (R², MAE, RMSE)

Visualize predictions and residuals

Deploy model via a simple API or dashboard (optional)
